[Section III](#22-subsystem-design) includes …

# 2.	Architectural and Component-level Design
## 2.1 System Structure

This section should describe the high-level architecture of your software:  i.e., the major subsystems and how they fit together. 
If you adopted the application structure we used in the Smile App, your application would have the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. If you adopted a different architectural pattern, mention the pattern you adopted in your software and briefly discuss the rationale for using the proposed architecture (i.e., why that pattern fits well for your system).

In this section:
 * Provide a UML component diagram that illustrates the architecture of your software.
 * Briefly mention the role of each subsystem in your architectural design. 
 * Discuss the rationale for the proposed decomposition in terms of  coupling and re-use.

## 2.2 Subsystem Design 

(**Note1**: This is just a suggested template. If you adopted a pattern other than MVC, you should revise this template and the list the major subsystems in your architectural design.)

(**Note2**: You should describe the design for the end product (completed application) - not only your iteration1 version. You will revise this document in iteration-2 and make changes  and/or add more details in iteration-2.)

### 2.2.1 Model

Briefly explain the role of the model. 

(***in iteration-1***) Include a list of the tables (models) in your database and explain the role of each table. Provide the attributes of the tables (including relationships). 

1. Review
  Role:
  - Represents user reviews for books.
  Attributes:
    - id (Primary Key): An integer representing the unique identifier for each review.
    - title: A string (up to 150 characters) for the title of the review.
    - body: A string (up to 1500 characters) for the review content.
    - timestamp: A DateTime field that stores the review's creation timestamp.
    - likes: An integer representing the number of likes on the review.

2. User
  Role:
  - Represents user accounts in the application.
  Attributes:
    - id (Primary Key): An integer representing the unique identifier for each user.
    - username: A string (up to 64 characters) for the user's username.
    - email: A string (up to 120 characters) for the user's email address.
    - password_hash: A string (128 characters) for storing the hashed password.
    - Relationship:
      - review: A relationship with the Review table will be added, not defined yet.

3. Book
  Role:
  - Represents books and their details.
  Attributes:
    - id (Primary Key): An integer representing the unique identifier for each book.
    - title: A string (up to 150 characters) for the book's title.
    - author: A string (up to 30 characters) for the book's author.
    - year: An integer representing the year of the book (foreign key to the Year table).
    - timestamp: A DateTime field that stores the book's creation timestamp.
    - Relationships:
      - reviews: A many-to-many relationship with the Review table, defined through the reviewBook association table.
      - genres. A many-to-many relationship with the Genre table, defined through an association table.

4. Year
  Role:
  - Represents years in which books were published.
  Attributes:
    - id (Primary Key): An integer representing the unique identifier for each year.
    - year: An integer representing the year.
    - Relationships:
    - books: A one-to-many relationship with the Book table, allowing multiple books to be associated with a specific year.

5. Genre (not defined yet)
  Role: 
    - Represent book genres.
  Attributes:
      - id (Primary Key): An integer representing a book genre.
      - name: A string representing the name of the genre.

(***in iteration -2***) Revise the database model. Provide a UML diagram of your database model showing the associations and relationships among tables. Your UML diagram should also show the methods of your models.

### 2.2.2 Controller

Briefly explain the role of the controller. If your controller is decomposed into smaller subsystems (similar to the Smile App design we discussed in class), list each of those subsystems as subsections. 

For each subsystem:
 * Explain the role of the subsystem (component) and its responsibilities.
 * 	Provide a detailed description of the subsystem interface, i.e., 
    * which other subsystems does it interact with?  
    * what are the interdependencies between them? 

**Note:** Some of your subsystems will interact with the Web clients (browsers). Make sure to include a detailed description of the routes your application will implement. For each route specify its “methods”, “URL path”, and “a description of the operation it implements”.  
You can use the following table template to list your route specifications. 

(***in iteration-1***) Brainstorm with your team members and identify all routes you need to implement for the completed application and explain each route briefly. If you included most of the major routes but you missed only a few, it maybe still acceptable. 

routes subsystem:
  - This subsystem primarily deals with routes related to the main functionality of the application, including managing books, reviews, and user interactions.

  index Route:
    URL Path: / and /index
    Method: GET
    Description: Renders the main index page of the application, displaying books and allowing users to interact with them. It fetches a list of books and passes them to the template.

  postReview Route:
    URL Path: /postreview<book_id>
    Methods: GET and POST
    Description: Handles the creation of reviews for a specific book. It takes a book ID as a parameter, retrieves the book, and allows users to submit reviews for that book.

  addbook Route:
    URL Path: /addbook
    Methods: GET and POST
    Description: Allows users to add new books to the system. It handles the form submission and book creation, displaying a form for entering book details.

  reviews Route:
    URL Path: /reviews<book_id>
    Method: GET
    Description: Displays reviews for a specific book. Users can see the reviews associated with a book.

  like Route:
    URL Path: /like/<review_id> <book_id>
    Method: POST
    Description: Handles the process of liking a review. It increments the like count for a review and redirects back to the reviews page for the associated book.

bp_auth Subsystem:
  - This subsystem is responsible for user authentication and registration.

admin_registration Route:
  URL Path: /admin_registration
  Methods: GET and POST
  Description: Handles the registration of admin users. It allows admins to create accounts, setting the user type to "Admin."
  regular_registration Route:

URL Path: /regular_registration
  Methods: GET and POST
  Description: Handles the registration of regular users. It allows regular users to create accounts, setting the user type to "Reg_User."

login Route:
  URL Path: /login
  Methods: GET and POST
  Description: Handles user login. Users can enter their credentials to log in. If successful, they are redirected to the main index page.

logout Route:
  URL Path: /logout
  Methods: GET and POST
  Description: Allows users to log out of their accounts. After logging out, users are redirected to the main index page.

(***in iteration-2***) Revise your route specifications, add the missing routes to your list, and update the routes you modified. Make sure to provide sufficient detail for each route. In iteration-2, you will be deducted points if you don’t include all major routes needed for implementing the required use-cases or if you haven’t described them in detail.

|   | Methods           | URL Path   | Description  |
|:--|:------------------|:-----------|:-------------|
|1. |                   |            |              |
|2. |                   |            |              |
|3. |                   |            |              |
|4. |                   |            |              |
|5. |                   |            |              |
|6. |                   |            |              |


### 2.2.3 View and User Interface Design 

Briefly explain the role of the view. Explain how you plan to build the user interfaces and mention the frameworks/libraries you plan to use (e.g., Bootstrap).  

Provide a list of the page templates you plan to create (or you already created). Briefly describe the information that will be displayed on those pages and the forms that will be rendered (i.e., explain the input and output for each page). Make sure to mention which use-cases in your “Requirements Specification” document will utilize these interfaces for user interaction. You can supplement your description with UI sketches or screenshots. 

(***in iteration-1***) Brainstorm with your team members and identify the pages that you think should be created.  If you included most of the major pages, it will be acceptable. 

(***in iteration-2***) Revise your page list and descriptions and include any additional pages that you will include in your view.  In iteration-2, you will be deducted points if your view description is still superficial and doesn't list and explain all pages of your application. 


# 3. Progress Report

Write a short paragraph summarizing your progress in iteration1 / iteration2.

# 4. Testing Plan

(***in iteration 1***)
Don't include this section.

(***in iteration 2***)
In this section , provide a brief description of how you plan to test the system. Thought should be given to  mostly how automatic testing can be carried out, so as to maximize the limited number of human hours you will have for testing your system. Consider the following kinds of testing:
  * *Unit Testing*: Explain for what modules you plan to write unit tests, and what framework you plan to use.  (Each team should write automated tests (at least) for testing the routes)
  * *Functional Testing*: How will you test your system to verify that the use cases are implemented correctly? 
  * *UI Testing*: How do you plan to test the user interface?  (Manual tests are OK)

# 5. References

Cite your references here.

For the papers you cite give the authors, the title of the article, the journal name, journal volume number, date of publication and inclusive page numbers. Giving only the URL for the journal is not appropriate.

For the websites, give the title, author (if applicable) and the website URL.
